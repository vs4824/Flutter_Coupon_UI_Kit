# Flutter Coupon UI Kit

A simple package that provides you with some widgets and cutom clippers which implements the shape of a coupon card.

## Usage

There are two ways to get started:

1. Using the provided built-in widget CouponCard class that has a different properties, so you don't do anything else.

2. Using the provided clipper CouponClipper class which in this case if you want to implement the widget your self but you just need a clipper to do that.
